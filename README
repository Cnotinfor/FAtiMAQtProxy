FAtiMAQtProxy is a project to create a proxy between FAtiMA agents and Qt applications.

FAtiMA is an Agent Mind component developed by INESC-ID in Java. It uses sockets to communicate
with other components, so it can be easily integrated with other technologies, besides Java.

The current version doesn't understand the all instructions sent by FAtiMA.
